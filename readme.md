# Makefile for the Front End

I've used this Makefile for a fast development environment for a side-project 
that I no longer continue.

You can clone this repository to kickstart a frontend project. Required folder 
structure is set up for Makefile to work.

#### TL;DR

 - Use [static, non-preprocessed CSS](https://css-tricks.com/dont-use-css-preprocessors/) with [livereload](https://github.com/napcs/node-livereload) to give lightning-fast 
 prototyping abilities.

 - Use [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) + [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) to compile JSX and enable ES2015. Also auto-refresh 
 the browser.

 - Minify HTML ([html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)), CSS ([cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano)), JS ([uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)) for production.

 - Use PostCSS plugins ([import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import), [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)) for production CSS.


## Why Make?

I'm using Make to manage ops-side of my front-end projects because it's simple.
In Gulp, Grunt or Webpack or any other tool, you have to comprehend the complexity
of programmatic usage and learn how some 3rd party abstractions work.

When, instead, Make is used for the same tasks, it's much easier for anyone to
contribute, fix or make any kind of change on the build script (at least for me). 
It's not asynchronous, it doesn't give you abstractions to "make your job easier". 
It's flat. You read a Makefile in sequential order, with no indirection.

## Setup

You need `Node` and `npm` installed on your machine which is capable of running 
Makefiles (i.e: not Windows as far as I know).

```
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:scriptype/Makefile-for-the-Front-End.git

# Go to project directory
cd Makefile-for-the-Front-End

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

Besides modules used in Makefile, `react` and `react-dom` for JS and 
`express` for dev-server will also be installed. They are not mandatory.

## Run

#### Development

```sh
make

# in a separate session:
node server dev
```

When finished, head over to `localhost:8989/dist`

#### Production

```sh
make release

# in a separate session:
node server prod
```

When finished, head over to `localhost:8989`

## Notes

  - It's far from being perfect (and it's not intented to be).

  - `Express` dependency is for `server.js`. You can remove it and handle 
  dev-server however you like. `env.js` is also used only in `server.js`

  - JS files are preprocessed for compiling `JSX` and enabling `ES2015` syntax.

  - `Watchify` is used in combination with `livereload` for JS source.

  - Handlebars is used in `index.html` to dynamically manipulate the path of JS 
  and CSS files according to environment. It also calls livereload script in dev mode.

  - No CSS pre-processor was used. CSS files are completely static in dev mode and 
  source files are directly used. You get an experience similar to  prototyping in 
  browser thanks to livereload.

  - As `src/style.css` is used during development, your __dev server should serve 
  root directory__ of project instead of only `/dist`. Yet since `index.html` is 
  still in /dist, in order to view the page in browser, __you should type 
  `localhost:port/dist` in address bar__. This is not a problem after release.

  - You can see `@import` rules actually cause requests to css files in dev mode.

  - When releasing the project:

    - `@import`ed css files will be concatenated into a single file.

    - CSS will be autoprefixed.

    - JS modules will be babelified to normalize JSX and ES2015.

    - HTML, JS and CSS outputs will be minified.

## Contribution

Don't hesitate to open issues and making pull requests. When doing that, consider 
this boilerplate is aimed to have minimum complexity. e.g: Implementing redux for JS 
is out of scope of this project.
